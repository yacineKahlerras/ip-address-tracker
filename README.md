## Overview

This one was a fun one to make it uses two different api's, the first one [IP Geolocation API by IPify](https://geo.ipify.org/) gets your IP address and finds its location and sends back approximate coordinates of that location. The second one [LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/) uses those coordinates to display the location on a map. You can click on the dice button to go random locations and explore them.
